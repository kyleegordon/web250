                        I, <a href="introduction.html">Kylee N. Gordon</a> agree to
                        abide by the terms in my Spring 2022 WEB250 - N801 course with
                        my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal
                        websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not
                        put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or
                        that I wish to keep private.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also understand that it is my work that counts for
                        attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
                        failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
                    </p>
